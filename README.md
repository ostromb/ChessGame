# MVP
Our MVP is a functioning chess game without any special features. This means that the program will not warn when in check och check-mate, but this chess game functions more as real physical chess game. Observe that illegal moves will be drawn on the board. Also, en passant and castling will not be built in. Promoting pawns is also not something that can be done.
